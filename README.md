The SMA Sunny Boy Inverter Query tool uses the SpeedWireâ„¢ protocol to query models of SunnyBoy inverter that support the protocol. The protocol was primarily decoded from analysis and replay of commands extracted from network dumps.

Some critical information regarding login was found in this post https://community.openhab.org/t/example-on-how-to-access-data-of-a-sunny-boy-sma-solar-inverter/50963 on the openHAP forum. Thank you to jan_r and all contributors to that thread!

This library supports a stand-alone MQTT mode, however, it is primarily intended to be used with Home Assistant.
